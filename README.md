# Read Me - Optical Character Recognition App
This Android app is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application built with Android Studio. 
The app uses the device's camera to capture an image of text, which is then processed using OCR to extract the text from the image. 
The extracted text can then be copied to the clipboard or shared with other apps on the device.
